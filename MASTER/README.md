# Daily-Picture-Aligner
This program is intended to eventually be able to take all photos in a folder and align them automatically based on a given feature (eye, hair, eyebrow, etc.)
I plan for it to use opencv2 to align pictures based on a given feature, but (as of 10-8-2020) I haven't learned any opencv2 besides basic things (imread, imshow, waitkey, etc.)

# Current Version (Third)
- sorted pictures by date
- wrote picture list to file to be read. not sure why its useful. im sure i had a reason but i forgot
- made the code cleaner i think....

# Issues
- There's a problem where files aren't either being added to the list or aren't being displayed, with my directory of images about 80 of the 200+ images aren't being displayed. 
- Files aren't displayed in order either, which deafeats the purpose of what I'm trying to make.

# ToDo
- Learn opencv drawing and identifying specific features (I don't know any of the actual termonoligy)
- Have adjusted pictures be written to a new directory.
- Possibly choices to be aligned at different features (hair, eyebrows, leg, torso, etc.).
- Possibly create and option for in which order they'll be displayed (oldest, latest).

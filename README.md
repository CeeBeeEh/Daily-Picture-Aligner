# Daily-Picture-Aligner
This program is intended to eventually be able to take all photos in a folder and align them automatically based on a given feature (eye, hair, eyebrow, etc.)
I plan for it to use opencv2 to align pictures based on a given feature, but (as of 10-8-2020) I haven't learned any opencv2 besides basic things (imread, imshow, waitkey, etc.)
# First Commit (program capabilities)
### Completed
- File managment, gathering pictures from a given directory and taking all photos from it that aren't curropted (0 bytes in size). Opencv2 can display all of the pictures without any alignment, just raw pictures (not raw as in file type).
### ToDo
- Learn opencv drawing and identifying specific features (I don't know any of the actual termonoligy)
- Have adjusted pictures be written to a new directory.
- Possibly choices to be aligned at different features (hair, eyebrows, leg, torso, etc.).

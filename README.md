# Daily-Picture-Aligner
This program is intended to eventually be able to take all photos in a folder and align them automatically based on a given feature (eye, hair, eyebrow, etc.). 
I plan for it to use opencv2 to align pictures based on a given feature, but (as of 10-8-2020) I haven't learned any opencv2 besides basic things (imread, imshow, waitkey, etc.)

# Inspiration
- I wanted to make this after manually aligning the first 60 pictures of my picture-every-day project. It took hours in total and I hope this can save me and lots of people time. 
- I want to make a tutorial which will have an easier to use executable file for people on YouTube who might be wanting to do a similar thing without getting discouraged with all the editing programs or github pages.
- Resume project and something that could give me ego points if I post to reddit
- ## As with all personal projects, I hope to learn more about coding, github, and the entire process as a whole; I want to increase my experience.

# Current Version (Third)
- sorted pictures by date
- wrote picture list to file to be read. not sure why its useful. im sure i had a reason but i forgot
- made the code cleaner i think....

# Contributions
- I'm creating this for a project and only individuals who signed up with me can contribute. In a few months I would appreciate any and all new contributions.
- This said, you can make a contribution to all github related material. 

# Issues
- None that I'm aware of.

# ToDo
- Move from OpenCv haarcascades, to google's mediapipe to find the eye pupils not only more accurately but also faster and more efficiently.
- Have adjusted pictures be written to a new directory.
- Possibly choices to be aligned at different features (hair, eyebrows, leg, torso, etc.).
- Possibly create and option for in which order they'll be displayed (oldest, latest).
- Possible create a GUI version
